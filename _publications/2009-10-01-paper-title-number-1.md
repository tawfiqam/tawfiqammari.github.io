excerpt: 'Denmark is a generous welfare state which provides resources and legal means for fathers to take their parental role seriously and engage with their children. In this paper, we explore the relation between Danish fathers’ interaction online and the societal, legal, and economic infrastructures in which they are situated. By focusing on  how  fathers living  in  Denmark make  use  of  the  Internetand  social  media  sites  to  facilitate  their  role  as parents, we are able to explore how online engagement is shaped by the different societal ‘norms’ of parenting. Our  research  outlines  the  ways  in  which  societal  infrastructures  influence  how  fathers  perceive,  and subsequently make use of social media in relation to child-caring. We find that fathers discuss their experiences of legal inequitiesand stereotypical discrimination on social network siteslike Facebook.We also studyfathers’ online reviewsof a Danish parenting App, FAR,designed specifically to support fathers. By analyzing social media  discussions  around  fatherhood  in  Denmark,  we found  connections  to  the  ways  in  whichthe  current political climate shapes and influences fatherhood in Denmark,as they reflect the societal infrastructures which situate fathersin contemporary Denmark.Further, we found a strong political interest for collective action to transformthesocietal infrastructures tosupport legal equality for child caretaking across genders. This strong political motivation is distinctfrom existing studies exploring how fatherhood is displayed on social media in other countries such as the USA. On this basis, we argue that research exploring social media use in institutions which are strongly shaped by societal norms, must explicitly consider the role which society takes in shaping such institutions, and include these aspects into the analysis. Our data show that fathers use social media sites as  platformsto  produce  a  fatherhood  more  in  line  with  their  lived  experience  of  parenting,  and  that  they advocate for collective political action to strengthenfathers’legal rights.'
